# claudiator-hook

A Rust CLI that runs as a Claude Code hook, reading JSON hook events from stdin and forwarding them to a Claudiator server for centralized session monitoring across devices.

## Overview

`claudiator-hook` is the client-side component that captures Claude Code session events and reports them to a Claudiator server, enabling you to monitor all your parallel Claude Code sessions across devices from one central dashboard. It reads hook events from stdin, enriches them with device metadata, and POSTs them via HTTP.

Configuration is loaded from `~/.claude/claudiator/config.toml`.

## Build

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/claudiator-hook`.

## CLI Usage

### Send Event

Read a hook event from stdin and send it to the configured server:

```bash
claudiator-hook send
```

This subcommand is typically called by Claude Code hooks. It reads JSON from stdin, parses the event, and POSTs it to the server.

#### `--raw-event-log <path>`

Append the raw stdin JSON to a local JSONL file before parsing or sending:

```bash
claudiator-hook send --raw-event-log ~/.claude/claudiator/events.jsonl
```

Each event is written as a single line (JSONL format). The file and any missing parent directories are created automatically. This flag overrides `raw_event_log_path` in `config.toml`. See [Raw Event Logging](#raw-event-logging) for details.

### Global Options

#### `--log-level <level>`

Override the log level for this invocation. Can be placed before or after the subcommand:

```bash
claudiator-hook --log-level debug send
claudiator-hook send --log-level debug
```

Valid levels: `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` (case-insensitive).

### Test Connection

Test connectivity to the configured Claudiator server:

```bash
claudiator-hook test
```

Sends a ping request to verify server availability and authentication.

### Version

Print the version and exit:

```bash
claudiator-hook version
```

## Configuration

Configuration file location: `~/.claude/claudiator/config.toml`

### Format

```toml
server_url = "https://api.claudiator.example.com"
api_key = "your-api-key-here"
device_name = "MacBook Pro"
device_id = "unique-device-identifier"
platform = "mac"

# Logging (optional — defaults shown)
log_level = "error"
max_log_size_bytes = 1048576
max_log_backups = 2

# Raw event logging (optional — disabled by default)
# raw_event_log_path = "~/.claude/claudiator/events.jsonl"
```

### Fields

- `server_url` — Base URL of the Claudiator server
- `api_key` — Authentication key for the server
- `device_name` — Human-readable device name
- `device_id` — Unique identifier for this device
- `platform` — Operating system platform (e.g., "darwin", "linux", "windows")
- `log_level` — Minimum log level: `error`, `warn`, `info`, or `debug` (default: `"error"`)
- `max_log_size_bytes` — Maximum log file size in bytes before rotation (default: `1048576` / 1 MB)
- `max_log_backups` — Number of rotated log files to keep (default: `2`)
- `raw_event_log_path` — Path to append raw hook events in JSONL format; absent or omitted means raw logging is disabled (default: unset)

## Logging

All log output is written to `~/.claude/claudiator/error.log`. The hook never writes to stderr during `send` mode to avoid interfering with Claude Code.

### Log Levels

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `error` | Errors only (default) |
| `warn` | Errors and warnings |
| `info` | Errors, warnings, and informational messages |
| `debug` | All messages including debug details |

### Log Level Precedence

The log level is resolved in this order (first match wins):

1. `--log-level` CLI flag
2. `CLAUDIATOR_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
3. `log_level` in `config.toml`
4. Default: `error`

### Log Rotation

When the log file exceeds `max_log_size_bytes`, it is rotated:

- `error.log` is renamed to `error.log.1`
- Existing backups shift: `.1` becomes `.2`, etc.
- The oldest backup beyond `max_log_backups` is deleted
- If `max_log_backups` is `0`, the file is truncated instead of rotated

## Raw Event Logging

When enabled, the hook appends the full, unmodified stdin JSON to a local JSONL file **before** any parsing or field trimming. This is useful for:

- Inspecting exactly what Claude Code is sending for each event type
- Detecting when new fields appear after a Claude Code update
- Offline analysis and schema change tracking

### Enabling

Set `raw_event_log_path` in `config.toml`:

```toml
raw_event_log_path = "~/.claude/claudiator/events.jsonl"
```

Or pass `--raw-event-log` on the CLI for a one-off override:

```bash
claudiator-hook send --raw-event-log /tmp/debug-events.jsonl
```

The CLI flag takes precedence over `config.toml`. If neither is set, raw logging is disabled.

### Format

Each event is written as a single trimmed JSON object followed by a newline (JSONL / NDJSON):

```jsonl
{"session_id":"abc123","hook_event_name":"Stop","cwd":"/workspace","stop_hook_active":false}
{"session_id":"abc123","hook_event_name":"Notification","notification_type":"info","message":"Done"}
```

The file is opened in append mode, so existing entries are never overwritten. Parent directories are created automatically if they don't exist.

### Privacy note

The raw log captures **all fields** from the Claude Code event, including high-sensitivity fields such as `tool_input`, `tool_output`, `custom_instructions`, and `transcript_path` that are otherwise stripped before transmission. Only enable this on machines where the log path is appropriately protected.

## Test Server

A local test server is provided for development and testing.

### Running

```bash
cd test-server
cargo run -- --port 3000 --api-key test-key
```

### Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/ping` — Health check endpoint
- `POST /api/v1/events` — Event ingestion endpoint

The test server validates the API key via the `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header and logs all received events to stdout.

## Installation Scripts

Automated installers are provided in the `scripts/` directory:

- `scripts/install.sh` — macOS/Linux installer
- `scripts/install.ps1` — Windows installer

These scripts:

1. Download the latest release binary
2. Prompt for configuration values (server URL, API key, device info)
3. Create the config file at `~/.claude/claudiator/config.toml`
4. Optionally configure Claude Code hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`

## Claude Code Hook Integration

To integrate with Claude Code, add the hook to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "SessionEnd": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "Stop": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "Notification": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "PermissionRequest": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "TeammateIdle": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "TaskCompleted": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }]
  }
}
```

When any of these events occur, Claude Code will invoke `claudiator-hook send` with the event JSON on stdin.

## Claude Code HTTP Hook Integration (Direct)

Claude Code also supports HTTP hooks that POST the hook event JSON directly to a URL. Use this if you want to bypass the `claudiator-hook` binary and send events straight to the server.

Add HTTP hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [{
      "matcher": "",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://your-server.example.com/api/v1/hooks/http",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer $CLAUDIATOR_API_KEY",
          "X-Claudiator-Device-Id": "$CLAUDIATOR_DEVICE_ID",
          "X-Claudiator-Device-Name": "$CLAUDIATOR_DEVICE_NAME",
          "X-Claudiator-Platform": "$CLAUDIATOR_PLATFORM"
        },
        "allowedEnvVars": [
          "CLAUDIATOR_API_KEY",
          "CLAUDIATOR_DEVICE_ID",
          "CLAUDIATOR_DEVICE_NAME",
          "CLAUDIATOR_PLATFORM"
        ]
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

HTTP hook requests are authenticated the same way as the stdin hook client and must include the device headers shown above.

### Supported Events

- `SessionStart` — Fired when a new Claude Code session begins
- `SessionEnd` — Fired when a session ends
- `Stop` — Fired when execution is stopped
- `Notification` — Fired when notifications are generated
- `UserPromptSubmit` — Fired when a user submits a prompt
- `PermissionRequest` — Fired when a tool permission is requested
- `TeammateIdle` — Fired when a teammate agent goes idle
- `TaskCompleted` — Fired when a task is completed

### Opt-in: Sub-Agent Events

Sub-agent hooks (`SubagentStart`, `SubagentStop`) are **not installed by default** because they fire for every spawned sub-agent and can generate significant volume when using teams or parallel agents. To opt in, add them manually to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SubagentStart": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }],
    "SubagentStop": [{ "matcher": "", "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/claudiator/claudiator-hook send"}] }]
  }
}
```
